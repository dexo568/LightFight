CREATING A NEW PLANET:

Within Unity3D Editor, press CTRL + N to start a new, empty scene.

(1) Go to the menu

		GameObject -> Create Other -> Ethereal Planet

	to create a new Ethereal Planet. Your new Planet will have a default radius of 64 units, and no textures at all.

	Notice that a warning appears in the Console, saying "Planet Ethereal Planet has no Sun. Please select a Light as the Sun for this Planet."

	We need a light to act as the Sun light for the Planet.

(2) Go to the menu

		GameObject -> Create Other -> Point Light

	to create a Sun light for your Planet.

(3) In the Hierarchy Panel, click the Ethereal Planet to select it. In the Inspector, find the "Sun Transform" field, click it and select the Light as the Sun for this Planet.

(4) Select the Point Light and move it above the Planet.

(5) Select the Main Camera and move it so that you can see the entire Planet in the Camera Preview.

(6) In the Project Panel, find the zSample folder, open it, open the Scripts folder, and find the CCameraOrbit script. Drag this script to the Main Camera in the Hierarchy Panel.

	This script has some basic flying controls to move the Camera through the space, like:

	[W] accelerate;
	[SHIFT] + [W] accelerate faster;

	[S] reverse accelerate;
	[SHIFT] + [S] reverse accelerate faster;

	[MOUSE MOVE] rotate camera;
	[A] or [D] + [MOUSE MOVE] rotate differently (roll locked);

	[SPACE] speed decrease until stop;

(7) Select the Ethereal Planet again. In the Inspector, find the "Water Tex" field, click on it, and select the "water 512" texture included in the sample package.

	You should now see a water in the Planet.

(8) In the Inspector, find the "Water Normal" field, click on it, and select the "723-normal" texture included in the sample package.

	The water is now normal-mapped.

(9) In the Inspector, find the "Water Tex Tile" field, click on it, and change the value to 32.

	The water is tiling 32 times now, giving it a more realistic scale relative to the Planet size.

(10) In the Inspector, find the "Base Tex" field, click on it, and select the "forest 2" texture included in the sample package.

	You should see the terrain with a grass texture.

(11) Please save and run the scene now, and look around a bit.

	You should see a basic planet with land and water.

(12) Stop the scene.

(13) Select the Ethereal Planet again, go to the Inspector, find the "Has Atmosphere" field, and enable it.

(14) Save and run the scene again.

	You should now see a bright horizon and a sky degradee around the Planet.

	Lets add a sun Billboard to this scene.

(15) Stop the scene again.

(16) Go to the menu

		GameObject -> Create Other -> Plane

(17) In the Hierarchy Panel, drag the Plane over the Point Light object, to make it a child of the Sun. Make sure that the Plane is at coordinates 0,0,0 after dragging it.

(18) Select the Plane and change its Scale in the Inspector to 5, 5, 5.

	The Plane will look bigger in size.

(19) In the Project Panel, within Resources -> zSample -> Materials, find the "Sun" Material, and drag it over the Plane in the Hierarchy Panel.

	The Plane should now have a Sun Texture (the Sun Texture is included in the sample package).

(20) In the folder zSample -> Scripts, drag the Billboard script over the Plane in the Hiearchy Panel.

	Now the Plane will always look directly at the Main Camera, when the scene is running.

(21) Please save and run the scene again.
